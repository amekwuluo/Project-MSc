1.1	Introduction
Airline services play a pivotal role in the global transportation industry. They facilitate rapid movement of people and goods across short and long distances, connecting states, countries and continents, and significantly contributing to economic development. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports that the airline industry supports 65.5 million jobs worldwide and contributes $2.7 trillion to the global economy, representing 3.6% of global GDP (Simon, 2022).
In 2019, airlines transported more than 4.5 billion passengers. Although there was a temporary decline in numbers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, passenger traffic is expected to recover and continue growing. The air cargo sector is also crucial, with airlines moving roughly 52 million metric tons of goods each year, which represents about 35% of the global trade value (Dawod & Saeed Sharif, 2021). 
The above paragraphs highlight the critical role airlines play not just in passenger travel but also in facilitating international trade. It is worthy for us to state that apart from other various services that are rendered by these airlines, this industry is no stranger to competition. 
According to Samir et al. (2023), the airline industry operates in a hyper-competitive environment. With multiple carriers vying for passengers on similar routes, even minor service deficiencies can significantly impact customer loyalty. In this landscape, airlines that prioritize service excellence and continuously strive to improve the passenger experience stand out. For example, the (IATA,2023) report highlights the customer base and revenue of the top five airlines—American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Emirates, and British Airways—leading the charge. 
Collectively, these airlines transported around 785 million passengers, representing approximately 15% of the global market. American Airlines topped the list with 215 million passengers and $54 billion in revenue, followed closely by Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, each with over 200 million passengers and revenues of $53 billion and $52 billion, respectively. Emirates and British Airways, while serving fewer passengers (80 million and 75 million, respectively), generated substantial revenues of $32 billion and $30 billion (IATA,2023).
Across these airlines, passenger services accounted for the largest share of revenue, ranging from 58% to 65%. The strong performance of these top airlines in 2023 highlights the industry's resilience and the critical role of customer-centric strategies in driving growth and profitability (IATA,2023).
Substandard airline services have a profound impact on customer satisfaction and the airline's reputation. For instance, frequent flight delays and cancellations, which affect as many as a quarter of passengers, often result in missed connections and disruptions to travel itineraries. Inadequate in-flight amenities, such as uncomfortable seating, poor-quality meals, and malfunctioning entertainment systems, are a concern for approximately 30% of travellers. These issues underscore the importance of airlines maintaining high standards of service to meet passenger expectations and ensure a positive travel experience (Juliana, 2021).
Additionally, baggage handling issues, such as lost or delayed luggage, impact about 15% of customers, causing significant frustration and inconvenience. The transparency and efficiency of refund and compensation processes are also common complaints, affecting about 10% of passengers who struggle to receive timely and fair resolutions(Lane, 2014). 
These service deficiencies not only diminish customer satisfaction but also lead to decreased loyalty, negative reviews, and potential loss of revenue as dissatisfied customers choose competitors with better service records. Addressing these issues is crucial for airlines to maintain a positive reputation and ensure long-term customer loyalty.
Even the top five airlines as stated above were not immune to the effects of poor services, which significantly impacted customer satisfaction. According to Rijitha (2023), flight delays and cancellations were a major issue, affecting around 20% of passengers across these airlines, leading to considerable frustration and logistical challenges. Inadequate in-flight amenities, such as uncomfortable seating and substandard meal options, were reported by approximately 25% of travellers, highlighting areas in need of improvement. Customer service inefficiencies, including unresponsive or unfriendly staff, were a common complaint for about 18% of passengers, contributing to negative travel experiences (Sumitha , 2023).
People's opinions and experiences serve as essential sources of information in our daily lives. Social media platforms are widely used for sharing comments and opinions about various products and services (Ahmad et al., 2018). For large organizations and companies, understanding customer or user feedback and sentiment is crucial. Consequently, companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of incorporating social media comments into their marketing strategies.
Customer feedback holds significant importance across industries, particularly in sectors like aviation. In the airline industry, where service quality and customer experience are paramount, feedback from passengers play a pivotal role in shaping service quality and passenger experiences (Kim & Kusakci, 2023). Airlines rely on feedback to gauge satisfaction levels, identify areas for improvement, and address concerns promptly. By analysing feedback, airlines can pinpoint recurring issues such as flight delays, baggage handling problems, or service deficiencies, allowing them to implement targeted solutions and enhance overall operational efficiency (Sumitha, 2023). 
Moreover, customer feedback serves as a barometer of performance against industry standards and competitors, guiding strategic decisions and resource allocations. Beyond operational benefits, actively seeking and acting upon feedback demonstrates a commitment to customer-centricity, fostering trust and loyalty among passengers. Ultimately, leveraging customer feedback not only improves service delivery but also strengthens an airline's reputation, positioning it competitively in a highly demanding market.
The airline industry is highly competitive, and providing excellent customer service is crucial for ensuring customer satisfaction and loyalty. Traditionally, airlines relied on surveys and basic customer service interactions to gauge customer satisfaction. However, these methods often yielded limited and subjective data.  The rise of digital communication has fundamentally transformed how airlines can gather and analyse customer feedback (Ban & Kim, 2019). 
Social media platforms, online review sites, and in-flight entertainment systems generate a vast amount of textual data in the form of reviews, comments, and complaints. This presents a unique opportunity for airlines to leverage cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to extract valuable insights and identify areas for improvement (Juliana, 2021). 
The NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. It aims to equip computers with the ability to understand the complexities of human language. NLP focuses on processing large amounts of text data from various sources like online reviews, social media comments, customer surveys, documents and emails and chat logs. The goal for NPL is extract valuable information from textual data, these can include identifying themes and trends, sentiment analysis and entity recognition (Hyun et al., 2019). 
British Airways is a major airline carrier based in the United Kingdom. It is one of the world's oldest airlines, having been founded in 1974. British Airways is a full-service global airline with its main hub at London Heathrow Airport (Lane, 2014). The combination of service excellence, global connectivity, customer-centric approach, and sustainability efforts positions British Airways as a preferred choice for discerning travellers looking for reliability, comfort, and a superior travel experience.
Despite the availability of customer feedback data, British Airways, like many other airlines, struggles to analyse and extract meaningful insights from the abundance of customer feedback they receive. The current manual processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and do not fully utilize the potential insights hidden in the unstructured text data. There is a pressing need to leverage AI-powered NLP techniques to efficiently process and analyse customer feedback to enhance service excellence and customer satisfaction.
To achieve the above, our dataset will be collected from various sources which include airline review websites, social media pages, travel forums, and digital interfaces. The collected data comprises textual reviews and scores related to seat comfort, staff service, in-flight entertainment, and overall customer satisfaction. Selection of data sources is based on relevance and volume to ensure a comprehensive dataset representing diverse customer experiences across geographical regions.
Again, this research will explore how AI-powered NLP can be used to analyse customer feedback for British Airways to evaluate service excellence.
