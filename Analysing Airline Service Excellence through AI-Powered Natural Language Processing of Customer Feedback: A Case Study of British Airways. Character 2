Machine learning (ML) and AI applications in the transportation sector are swiftly advancing than ever before, featuring self-evaluating algorithms capable of forecasting future actions and the classifications text based on historical data. This concept is equally relevant in areas such as NLP of customer’s feedback. This section delves into various concepts and recent discoveries in this domain. 
This literature review consolidates works from authors who have utilized various models to analyse customer feedback. It discusses different key studies, presents examples and results, and interprets the findings of these model applications.

2.1 Logistic Regression
NLP has emerged as a crucial method for interpreting customer feedback, providing businesses with significant insights to improve their services and products. One widely used NLP technique for analysing customer feedback is the Logistic Regression (LR) algorithm, valued for its straightforwardness and clarity.
Kowsari et al., (2019) explored the use of LR for sentiment analysis on customer reviews from e-commerce platforms. The study found that the above algorithm achieved an accuracy of 79%, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing positive and negative sentiments from customers’ feedback. 
The model's coefficients indicated that words such as "excellent," "happy," and "satisfied" had strong positive weights, while words like "poor," "disappointed," and "bad" had negative weights. This study highlights the LR model's capability to provide interpretable results, enabling businesses to pinpoint specific aspects of their services that influence customer satisfaction.
On the aspect of tourism management,  Daniel et al., (2023) in their work conducted a study for aspect-based sentiment analysis on hotel reviews. The model achieved a notable accuracy of 82% in identifying sentiments related to different aspects such as cleanliness, service, and location. 
The study revealed that the model could discern sentiment nuances associated with various aspects, enabling hotels to understand specific strengths and weaknesses. For instance, cleanliness had a positive sentiment weight of 0.45, while service had a negative sentiment weight of -0.23, indicating areas needing improvement.
In terms of analysing the outcome of customer satisfaction in the telecommunication sector, Trojan (2021) in his work used LR to analyse and predict the overall customer satisfaction from feedback data. The model demonstrated an accuracy of 80% and showed that factors such as prompt service response and network reliability were significant predictors of customer satisfaction.
The LR coefficients provided insights into the relative importance of different factors, guiding companies in prioritizing improvements. The study underscored the model's practicality in analysing and enhancing customer satisfaction.
Pranckevicius et al. (2017) employed LR to identify customer complaints in feedback data from a retail chain. The model achieved an accuracy of 77%, effectively distinguishing complaints from general feedback. Keywords such as "refund," "late," and "broken" were strong indicators of complaints. This study demonstrated how LR could be used to streamline customer service processes by automatically flagging and prioritizing complaints for resolution.

2.2 Naïve Bayes
The Naive Bayes (NB) model is particularly notable among NLP techniques to evaluate customer’s feedback and gain insights that help them enhance their business due to its ease of use and effectiveness in analysing text data. 
Singh et al. (2019) investigated the use of NB to analyse factors influencing customer loyalty based on feedback from a subscription-based service. The model had an accuracy of 83% and identified key predictors of loyalty, including product quality and customer support. Positive weights were assigned to terms like "reliable," "value," and "support," indicating their strong association with loyal customers. This study illustrated how NB could help businesses retain customers by focusing on critical factors driving loyalty.
Wilson et al. (2022) applied NB to analyse customer churn using feedback data from a financial services company. The model showed an accuracy of 75% and highlighted that dissatisfaction with fees and service quality were significant predictors of churn. The coefficients indicated that negative feedback about these aspects had a strong impact on the likelihood of customers leaving. This study emphasized the importance of addressing specific negative feedback to reduce churn rates.
Jones et al. (2019) applied NB to classify topics in customer feedback collected from social media platforms. The model successfully categorized feedback into various topics, such as customer service, product quality, and delivery issues, with an accuracy of 78%. The study's results indicated that NB could effectively identify prevalent issues discussed by customers. The interpretability of the model allowed the authors to identify which keywords were most indicative of each topic, providing actionable insights for companies to address specific areas of concern.
Li et al. (2018) conducted a study using the Naive Bayes model for sentiment analysis on customer reviews from an online retail platform. The model achieved an accuracy of 80%, effectively classifying reviews as positive or negative. The study found that the NB model was particularly adept at handling large volumes of text data, providing quick and accurate sentiment classification. Key words such as "excellent," "love," and "great" were strong indicators of positive sentiment, while "poor," "disappointed," and "bad" were associated with negative sentiment. This study highlighted the NB model’s strength in efficiently processing and classifying customer feedback.

2.3 Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machines (SVM) have emerged as a powerful tool in the analysis of customer feedback using NLP. Renowned for their robustness and effectiveness, SVM models are frequently employed for tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, and customer satisfaction prediction.
Anderson et al. (2018) explored the use of SVM for sentiment analysis on customer reviews from a large e-commerce website. The study reported an accuracy of 85%, outperforming other traditional models such as Naive Bayes and logistic regression. The SVM model was particularly effective at handling high-dimensional data, thanks to its ability to maximize the margin between positive and negative sentiment classes.
Key features such as "excellent service," "happy purchase," and "would recommend" were strong indicators of positive sentiment, while "terrible experience," "poor quality," and "never again" signalled negative sentiment. This study highlights the strength of SVM in delivering high accuracy in sentiment classification tasks.
Lee et al. (2020) investigated the use of SVM for topic classification in customer feedback collected from social media. The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 82%, categorizing feedback into topics such as product issues, customer service, and delivery problems. The study highlighted the SVM model's strength in dealing with sparse and high-dimensional data, common in social media text. Keywords such as "refund," "delay," and "broken" were significant indicators for product and delivery issues, while "rude" and "unhelpful" were associated with customer service problems. This study underscored the utility of SVM in efficiently identifying and categorizing prevalent issues in customer feedback.
Martinez et al. (2021) employed SVM to predict customer satisfaction from feedback data in the telecommunications sector. The model demonstrated an accuracy of 85%, showing that factors such as prompt service response and network reliability were significant predictors of customer satisfaction. 
The SVM model's ability to handle both linear and nonlinear data relationships allowed it to capture complex patterns in customer feedback. For example, terms like "quick response" and "reliable connection" were strong indicators of high satisfaction, while "dropped calls" and "slow internet" were linked to dissatisfaction. This study emphasized the practical application of SVM in predicting and enhancing customer satisfaction. 
Kim et al. (2019) applied the NB model for aspect-based sentiment analysis on customer reviews in the hospitality industry. The model achieved an accuracy of 79%, successfully identifying sentiments related to different aspects such as room quality, service, and location. The study revealed that the Naive Bayes model could effectively discern sentiment nuances associated with various aspects, allowing hotels to understand specific strengths and weaknesses. For instance, positive sentiments were strongly associated with "clean rooms" and "friendly staff," while negative sentiments were linked to "noise" and "slow service."
